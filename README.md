> A [PEP 723][] implementation

[PEP 723]: https://peps.python.org/pep-0723/

## Usage

Run like normal Python except that the first argument must be a path to the script.

```
idae example.py
```

The dependency specification within the Python script must be like the following (example from [PEP 723][]):

```python
#!/usr/bin/env idae
# /// pyproject
# [run]
# requires-python = ">=3.11"
# dependencies = [
#   "requests<3",
#   "rich",
# ]
# ///

import requests
from rich.pretty import pprint

resp = requests.get("https://peps.python.org/api/peps.json")
data = resp.json()
pprint([(k, v["title"]) for k, v in data.items()][:10])
```

If you need to pass arguments that look like options for `idae` to the script you want to run, use the standard UNIX convention of `--`. For example, let's say you have a script

```python
# script.py
import sys
print(" ".join(sys.argv[1:]))
```

and you want that script to output `I am --help`. To run it with Idae, use

```
idae script.py -- I am --help
```

## Caveats

- [No logging, or very minimal output reporting](https://github.com/ThatXliner/idae/issues/10)

## How it works

1. Detect script file
2. Detect appropriate Python executable
3. Use [venv][] to create a temporary virtual environment in the [user cache directory][] using the executable detected
4. Find [PEP 723][] `pip` requirements
5. Install them into the virtual environment
6. Run the script within the virtual environment

Run `idae clean` to remove all cached environments to free up space. Environments are cached per set of requirements.

[user cache directory]: https://platformdirs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#cache-directory

## Installation

You can get this project via `pip`

```bash
$ pip install idae
```

But we **highly recommend** you install this project using [pipx](https://pypa.github.io/pipx/)

```bash
$ pipx install idae
```

## Why the name

The scientific name for Pythons is "Pythonidae". I just removed the "Python" and we get "idae".
