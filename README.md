> A [PEP 772](https://peps.python.org/pep-0722/) implementation

## Usage

Run like normal Python except that the first argument must be a path to the script.

The dependency specification within the Python script must be like the following (example from PEP 772):

```python
# In order to run, this script needs the following 3rd party libraries
#
## Script Dependencies:
##    requests
##    rich

import requests
from rich.pretty import pprint

resp = requests.get("https://peps.python.org/api/peps.json")
data = resp.json()
pprint([(k, v["title"]) for k, v in data.items()][:10])
```

Basically, you specify your dependencies using the following comment format:

```python
## Script Dependencies:
##    dep-1
##    dep-2
##    etc
```

## How it works

1. Detect script file
2. Use [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) to create a temporary virtual environment named `idae-venv` using the Python executable used to run `idae`
3. Find PEP 772 requirements
4. Install them into the venv
5. Run the script within the venv
6. Delete the venv

## Installation

You can get this project via `pip`

```bash
$ pip install idae
```

But we **highly recommend** you install this project using [pipx](https://pypa.github.io/pipx/)

```bash
$ pipx install idae
```

## Why the name

The scientific name for Pythons is "Pythonidae". I just removed the "Python" and we get "idae".
